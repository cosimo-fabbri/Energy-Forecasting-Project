# Energy Forecasting Project
 University forecasting project about usage of machine learning algorithms to predict different scenarios within energy market

Our university project involved a comprehensive exploration of wind energy forecasting, centered around a hypothetical wind energy company named "RenewaBolo." Created by my colleague (Linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielehlatcu/?locale=en_US](url)) and me(Linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/cosimofabbri/](url), RenewaBolo served as a realistic model for applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to the field of renewable energy. The project's main objectives were to forecast critical aspects of wind energy production and market dynamics, using fictional scenarios designed to mirror real-world challenges as closely as possible. Here are the key areas of our analysis:

 • Average and 10th Quantile of Power Generation: We aimed to provide insights into both the overall energy production capabilities and potential worst-case scenarios for a wind turbine that RenewaBolo was considering acquiring. Regression models were employed to predict the power output of the turbine, helping us estimate both the average and lower quantile production levels.
 • Energy Production Frequency Based on Wind Speed: In anticipation of RenewaBolo's expansion into a new region, we analyzed the frequency of energy production from new turbines, given the condition that they would only generate power if wind speeds exceeded 5 km/h. Classification techniques, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, were utilized to assess the feasibility of this expansion based on wind speed data.
 • Future Energy Price Forecasting: Understanding the future market dynamics is crucial for any energy company. We applied time series forecasting methods to predict energy price trends for the upcoming week, enabling RenewaBolo to make informed decisions regarding energy sales and pricing strategies.
 
For these analyses, we utilized various datasets tailored to each task, including Data2018.xlsx for power generation forecasting, MT_station_Brasil.csv (converted to .xlsx) for the wind speed-based production frequency, and energy.xlsx for predicting energy prices.
